              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                myFlix is a web application built using MERN (MongoDB,
                Express.js, React.js, Node.js) that lets users view information
                about movies such as a synopsis, director, and genre. Users are
                able to sign up and login, update their personal profile
                information, and create a list of their favorite movies.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
              <p>
                This was part of Career Foundry's Full Stack Immersion course
                and was my first full stack application!
              </p>
              <br />
              <h2>Objective</h2>
              <p>
                The aim of this project was to showcase a full stack application
                to add to my professional portfolio. The problem I wanted to
                solve was learning to use React to build the front-end to
                display the data of the API I built for the back-end.

                  I created a REST API using Node and Express that interacts
                  with a non-relational database (MongoDB). This API allows
                  users to access a database to receive information on various
                  animated movies. The user is also able to view information
                  such as director, genre, synopsis, and year of release. The
                  API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or
                  POST. CRUD methods are used to store and retrieve data from
                  the MongoDB database.
                  <br />
                  Creation of API endpoints and route handlers were tested using
                  Postman. Data security consists of implementing basic HTTP
                  authentication for initial login requests as well as
                  implementing a login query with a generated JWT

              <p>
                After creating my API, I needed a library to help build the UI
                of my application that would receive requests from the
                server-side/back end. For this, I chose React. Some of the main
                reasons included the popularity of the library as well as the
                scope of my project. It consists of a single, responsive app
                that presents multiple views including a main view that shows
                all movies, a director view, a genre view, a single movie view
                that shows information about the selected movie, a login view, a
                registration view, and a profile view where users can update
                their information and see movies in their favorites.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
              My first challenge started with writing an API from scratch and
              learning to use a relational database. Many times I’d make a small
              typo or error and have to retrace my steps to fix any errors.
              Learning to use React was quite the task as at this point I only
              had slight experience with JavaScript. Many times, certain
              packages required for everything to work together would be
              deprecated or there would be new releases or updates that would
              break previous versions. With the help of my tutor and a lot of
              trial-and-error, I eventually persevered and created my first full
              stack project!

            <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>
              The entire project took about a month – from writing the API and
              learning to use MongoDB, to creating the front end and learning to
              use React.
